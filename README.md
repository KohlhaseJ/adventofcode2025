# adventofcode2025 🎄

Brush up on C++ solving some [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) puzzles on the way.

## See how puzzles are magically being solved 🔮

There are 12 puzzles in 2025, which can be found under https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/{x}.

The input data for a days puzzle goes into the resources folder as `./src/resources/day{x}.txt`. You can get your personal puzzle input for each day from `https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/{x}/input`.

Then just build and run the related `.src/day{x}.cpp` file using your favourite C++ builder and see the console output. You can e.g. check out the code, build and run it with VScode [C/C++ for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).
